        <p><strong>Claudius</strong> - The villain of the play, a calculating, ambitious politician, driven by his sexual appetites and his lust for power, but he occasionally shows signs of guilt and human feeling—his love for Gertrude, for instance, seems sincere. </p>
<p><strong>Hamlet</strong> - melancholy, bitter, and cynical, full of hatred for his uncle’s scheming and his mother’s frailty. </p>
<p><strong>Gertrude</strong> - Danish queen, the prince’s own mother. Pharaoh died she remarried Claudius. </p>
<p><strong>Ophelia</strong> - Polonius’s daughter, a beautiful young lady with whom Hamlet has been in love. Ophelia is a sweet and innocent young girl, who obeys her father and her brother, Laertes. </p>
<p><strong>The Ghost</strong> - The spectre of Hamlet’s recently deceased father. The ghost, who claims to have been murdered by Claudius, calls upon Hamlet to avenge him. </p>
<p><strong>Laertes</strong> - Polonius’s son. For his father and his sister’s death with swords killed Hamlet. He also died in the poison of the sword, though Hamlet didn’t realize sword is poisoned.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><strong>Hamlet’s Madness is Feigned</strong></p>
<p>Some hold that Shakespeare never intended to represent Hamlet as mad but expressly a feigner of madness, and even created the real madness of Ophelia, to contrast it with feigned madness. In every single instance in which Hamlet’s madness is manifested, he has good reason for assuming that madness: while, on the other hand, whenever there was no need to hoodwink anyone, his thought, language and action, bear no resemblance to unsoundness of intellect.” In Act I, Scene V, Hamlet tells Horatio and others that from now on he shall behave like a mad. His feigned madness provides him a great opportunity to find out the reality.:</p>
<p><strong><em>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>How strange or odd so e’er I bear myself,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>To put an antic disposition on……..\</em></strong></p>
<p>Hamlet’s madness is feigned on the ground that, on various occasions, he is seen in a good temper. His usage of phrases and ideas are not like that of an insane man. He rarely talks in a manner that compels us to say that Hamlet’s madness is real. In the Closet Scene, Hamlet tells his mother:</p>
<p><strong><em>That I essentially am not in madness\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>But mad in craft.\</em></strong></p>
<p>To prove the words of the ghost, Hamlet is going to stage a mock-play. No mad person can handle such things. Moreover, Hamlet also directs the actors about the play they are going to enact before the King. Hamlet also tells his friend, Horatio, to keep an eye on the King to catch his conscience, which no one can manage but a man of sense and intellect. Even Guildenstern and Rosencrantz do not think that Hamlet is mad. They describe his behaviour as a “crafty madness.” </p>
<p>In the Closet Scene, Hamlet convinces her mother in such a manner that she is compelled to accept her guilt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> She says:</p>
<p><strong><em>O Hamlet, speak no more:\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul;\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>And there I see such black and grained spots\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>As will not leave their tinct.\</em></strong></p>
<p>Hamlet’s comments on the art of acting are so effective and precise that such kinds of statements could not have come from the lips of an insane man. He advises the actors in the following manner:</p>
<p><strong><em>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>as many of your players do, I had as lief the\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw t***</em></strong>he air*<strong><br> *</strong>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;*<strong><br> *</strong>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,*<strong><br> *</strong>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget*<strong><br> *</strong>a temperance that may give it smoothness..…….***</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polonius is so much impressed with the replies of Hamlet that he remarks:</p>
<p>“ How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness his on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.”</p>
<p><strong>Hamlet’s Madness is Real</strong></p>
<p>Many critics are of the opinion that Hamlet’s madness is real on the basis of some grounds. Though, in the beginning of the play, he tells his friends that he is going to pretend as mad, yet due to the circumstances, his melancholic nature and grief over hasty marriage of his mother bring about drastic changes in his mental behaviour. Look at the following lines taken from Act II, Scene I, wherein Ophelia gives an account of the strange behaviour of Hamlet:</p>
<p><strong><em>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul’d,\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>Ungarter’d, and down-gyved to his ancle;\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>And with a look so piteous in purport\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>As if he had been loosed out of hell\</em></strong><br> <strong><em>To speak of horrors,—he comes before me.\</em></strong></p>
<p>She also tells her father that he took her by hand and took such a sigh, which was “so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk.” Polonius, when hears her statement about the strange behaviour of Hamlet, concludes that the strange behaviour of Hamlet is due to disappointment in love. Polonius calls his strange behaviour as “the very ecstasy of love.” </p>
<p>And in the nunnery scene, Hamlet insults Ophelia in the same manner as he insulted her earlier in the play. He advises her not to marry but to go to nunnery.</p>
<p>(“If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go. Farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.”)</p>
<p>This strange behaviour of Hamlet convinces Ophelia that he has really gone mad. She expresses her grief over the mental ailment of Hamlet in the following words:</p>
<p><strong><em>Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!—\</em></strong><br> <strong>*The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, to</strong>ngue, sword,……*<strong><br> *</strong>Oh, woe is me,*<strong><br> *</strong>T’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see!***</p>
<p>On the “vile king” Claudius.</p>
<p>Actually both Claudius and Hamlet ultimately sacrifice humanity and humaneness in the acquisition of their goals. But what makes Claudius a villain is that he is wrong to kill people merely to fulfill his own thirst for power and sex, and Hamlet is right for the vengeance on the vile king with a flag of integrity; Claudius is a sneak who murdered and lied. Hamlet commits his murders in the open and suffers the pangs of his own conscience. Claudius subverts his conscience and refuses to ask for divine forgiveness; Hamlet seeks contrition and absolves himself of guilt before he dies; Claudius receives no absolution and seeks none. Hamlet will spend eternity in Heaven; Claudius will burn in Hell.</p>
